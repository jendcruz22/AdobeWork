Paint the town red
Back to Square one
palace
between the devil and the deep blue sea
she is a mermaid on dry land and the world is her ocean
Throw kindness around like confetti
radiate positivity
be a light for all to see
Being Happy Never goes out of style
Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations
